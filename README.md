# Colour Metallography of Titanium Carbide in Martensitic Matrix

This repository contains research and findings on the colour metallography of titanium carbide (TiC) in a martensitic matrix. Colour metallography is an advanced characterization technique used in materials science to examine microstructures with enhanced contrast.

## Methodology

The process of color metallography involves the following steps:

1. Sample mounting
2. Paper polishing
3. Cloth polishing
4. Etchant preparation
5. Etching
6. Color microstructure analysis

## Etchant and Etching Process

- **Etchant Used**: Modified Weck's Reagent
  - Composition:
    - 50 ml distilled water
    - 12.5 ml ethanol
    - 1 g Ammonium Bifluoride
- **Etching Time**: 30 minutes

## Microscopy

Micrographs were captured at the following magnifications:
- 10x
- 20x
- 50x

Both high and low exposures were used. The eyepiece magnification was 10x

## Microstructural Observations

The color metallography revealed two distinct regions in the microstructure:

1. **Bright Regions**: Titanium Carbide (TiC)
   - Approximate composition: 30 wt%
2. **Dark Regions**: Martensite
   - Approximate composition: 70 wt%

## Significance

This research contributes to the understanding of the microstructure of titanium carbide in a martensitic matrix, which is crucial for various applications in materials science and engineering. The color metallography technique provides enhanced contrast, allowing for better visualization and analysis of the different phases present in the material.
